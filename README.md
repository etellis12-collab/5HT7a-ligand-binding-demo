# 5HT7a-ligand-binding-demo
A small, non-proprietary demo showing how to build a ligand-based model for predicting 5-HT7A receptor binding affinity (pKi). Includes RDKit-based featurization, physicochemical descriptor generation, and a simple machine-learning model to illustrate my coding style and interest in computational drug discovery.
